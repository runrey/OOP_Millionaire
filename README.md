# OOP_Millionaire
Developers of this project: Yernur Bolatkanov a.k.a runrey and Zaure Nurlan a.k.a luna.vo
The project is a console version of the well-known popular game "Who wants to be a millionaire?"

The logic of the project is simple as 1+1, the user logs in, then starts the game, if he scored more points than in the table of the best, then his record is added to this table. In addition, the project has added the ability to add questions within the project itself using administrator rights.

We have classes and subclasses such as, Questions and its branches as EasyQuestion, MediumQuestion and HardQuestion and QuestionBank class which stores all questions in its object. Next is People superclass with its Player, Host and Admin sublcasses. Database class stands for connection with DBMS. Eventually, main Game class where located all logics and Millionaire class where main method is located, where all game will be played.

The project was created on Eclipse IDE and MySQL DBMS.
